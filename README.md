## Requirements

- [ulauncher 5](https://ulauncher.io/)
- Python > 3

## Install

Open ulauncher preferences window -> extensions -> add extension and paste the following url:

`https://github.com/brpaz/ulauncher-github`

**This extension requires [PyGitHub](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) and [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) for it to work.**

You can install all the required dependencies by after installing the extension run the following command:

```bash
cd ~/.local/share/ulauncher/extensions/com.github.com.brpaz.ulauncher-github
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Before being able to start using the extension, you must generate a **Personal Access Token** (PAT) and configure it in the extension settings. The access token will allow the extension to access the GitHub API.

You can generate yours [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Make sure you select at least the permissions for "repo", "read:org", "gist", "user" and "notifications", otherwise you might see errors when using some specific commands in the extension.

This extension provides various commands/keywords to access the different functionality. If you type `GitHub` in Ulauncher you should see the available commands.

These include:

- GitHub: Search Repositories
- GitHub: Search Users
- GitHub: My Gists
- GitHub: My Organizations
- GitHub: My Assigned Issues
- GitHub: My Created Issues
- GitHub: My Assigned Pull Requests
- GitHub: My Created Pull Requests
- GitHub: My Notifications
- GitHub: My Repositories
- GitHub: My Account
- GitHub: Search Documentation
- GitHub: Extension Options

### Note on Cache

When the extension starts, it will download a list of all of your repositories, stars and gists and save them in a `json` file. This helps for performance reasons and GitHub API doesn¬¥t have a way to search on your own and organizations repostories in the same request.

This information is cached for 1 day by default. You can clear your cache and trigger a reindex of the local data by restarting ulauncher or by going to `GitHub: Extension Options -> Refresh cache`.

Depending on the number of repositories you have access, this indexing process might take some time. It is executed in the background and you will receive a notification when the process finishes.

## Development

```
git clone https://github.com/brpaz/ulauncher-github
make link
```

The ```make link``` will create a symbolic link to the ulauncher extensions folder.

Next, stop Ulauncher if running and run the following command:

```
make dev
```

This will start Ulauncher from the command line with all extensions disabled. In the output you will see something like this:

```
 VERBOSE=1 ULAUNCHER_WS_API=ws://127.0.0.1:5054/com.github.brpaz.ulauncher-github PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages /usr/bin/python3 /home/bruno/.local/share/ulauncher/extensions/com.github.brpaz.ulauncher-github/main.py
```

Run this, command in another terminal window, to laucnh the GitHub Extension.


## TODO

- Cache user repositories, gists and organizations in background for faster results.
